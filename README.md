# SnakeGameWithP5

In this project, I tried to simulate the classic Snake Game using P5.js Library by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM).

This game works but need ssome refactoring like-
  * Snake should not be allowed to change direction on same x- axis or y-axis. Currently if user tried to go backwards, same starts from beginning.
  * Snake also starts over if it hits the wall.
  
I will be making these changes in future.
